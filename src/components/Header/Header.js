                Have you ever had song lyrics in your head that you thought were
                the correct lyrics, just to find out later that you were wrong? 
                Lyrical Miracle is a site that intentionally generates fake 
                lyrics for any song your heart desires. It replaces words in the
                original lyrics with words that sound similar (but are 
                definitely wrong).
